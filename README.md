Exploratory Data Analysis of Future Learn's Cyber Security online course.

This report deals with Exploratory data analysis of the Survey for the Course Cyber Security offered by Future Learn using CRISP-DM methodology. The primary objective was to understand why enrollments in the course had lowered by investigating their behaviours as well as the course completion rate. Data from students who enrolled in the Cyber Security online course in late 2017 and 2018 was used for the research. Exploratory Data Analysis was used to better identify the gaps in the course and
reduce the course dropout rate. This report focuses on the reason for leaving, the last step completed by the student before leaving, and the week in which the students left the course after enrolling. The data of approximately 400 students were analysed by looking for patterns and determining when and why they left.
